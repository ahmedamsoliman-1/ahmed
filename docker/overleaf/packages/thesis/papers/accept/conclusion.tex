\section{Discussion}

\sysname differs from the other projects in this dissertation in its focus on a
robust, open-source, end-to-end implementation.
The goal is to demonstrate that a common compiler infrastructure can address
the common concerns for a wide variety of realistic approximation
techniques---in the same way that a classical compiler infrastructure like
LLVM provides all the tools that an intrepid compiler hacker needs to build
new optimizations.
This level of generality required that we solve two common challenges:
balancing programmer insight with automation,
and bridging the gap between fine-grained annotations and coarse-grained
optimizations.
